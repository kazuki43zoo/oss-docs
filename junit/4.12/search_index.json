Until now, the methods were simply invoked in the order returned by the reflection API. However, using the JVM order is unwise since the Java platform does not specify any particular order, and in fact JDK 7 returns a more or less random order. Of course, well-written test code would not assume any order, but some do, and a predictable failure is better than a random failure on certain platforms.\nFrom version 4.11, JUnit will by default use a deterministic, but not predictable, order (MethodSorters.DEFAULT). To change the test execution order simply annotate your test class using @FixMethodOrder and specify one of the available MethodSorters:\n@FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.JVM): Leaves the test methods in the order returned by the JVM. This order may vary from run to run.\n@FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.NAME_ASCENDING): Sorts the test methods by method name, in lexicographic order.\nExample\nimport org.junit.FixMethodOrder;\nimport org.junit.Test;\nimport org.junit.runners.MethodSorters;\n\n@FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.NAME_ASCENDING)\npublic class TestMethodOrder {\n\n    @Test\n    public void testA() {\n        System.out.println(\"first\");\n    }\n    @Test\n    public void testB() {\n        System.out.println(\"second\");\n    }\n    @Test\n    public void testC() {\n        System.out.println(\"third\");\n    }\n}\n\nAbove code will execute the test methods in the order of their names, sorted in ascending order\n"},"Exception-Testing.html":{"url":"Exception-Testing.html","title":"Exception Testing","keywords":"","body":"Expected Exceptions\nHow do you verify that code throws exceptions as expected?\nVerifying that code completes normally is important, but making sure the code behaves as expected in exceptional situations is vital too. For example:\nnew ArrayList().get(0);\n\nThis code should throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException. The @Test annotation has an optional parameter \"expected\" that takes as values subclasses of Throwable. If we wanted to verify that ArrayList throws the correct exception, we would write:\n@Test(expected = IndexOutOfBoundsException.class) \npublic void empty() { \n     new ArrayList().get(0); \n}\n\nThe expected parameter should be used with care. The above test will pass if any code in the method throws IndexOutOfBoundsException. For longer tests, it's recommended to use the ExpectedException rule, which is described below.\nDeeper Testing of the Exception\nThe above approach is useful for simple cases, but it has its limits. For example, you can't test the value of the message in the exception, or the state of a domain object after the exception has been thrown.  \nTry/Catch Idiom\nTo address this you can use the try/catch idiom which prevailed in JUnit 3.x:\n@Test\npublic void testExceptionMessage() {\n    try {\n        new ArrayList().get(0);\n        fail(\"Expected an IndexOutOfBoundsException to be thrown\");\n    } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException anIndexOutOfBoundsException) {\n        assertThat(anIndexOutOfBoundsException.getMessage(), is(\"Index: 0, Size: 0\"));\n    }\n}\n\nExpectedException Rule\nAlternatively, use the ExpectedException rule. This rule lets you indicate not only what exception you are expecting, but also the exception message you are expecting:\n@Rule\npublic ExpectedException thrown = ExpectedException.none();\n\n@Test\npublic void shouldTestExceptionMessage() throws IndexOutOfBoundsException {\n    List list = new ArrayList();\n\n    thrown.expect(IndexOutOfBoundsException.class);\n    thrown.expectMessage(\"Index: 0, Size: 0\");\n    list.get(0); // execution will never get past this line\n}\n\nThe expectMessage also lets you use Matchers, which gives you a bit more flexibility in your tests. An example:\nthrown.expectMessage(CoreMatchers.containsString(\"Size: 0\"));\n\nMoreover, you can use Matchers to inspect the Exception, useful if it has embedded state you wish to verify.  For example\nimport static org.hamcrest.Matchers.hasProperty;\nimport static org.hamcrest.Matchers.is;\nimport static org.hamcrest.Matchers.startsWith;\n\nimport javax.ws.rs.NotFoundException;\nimport javax.ws.rs.core.Response;\nimport javax.ws.rs.core.Response.Status;\n\nimport org.junit.Rule;\nimport org.junit.Test;\nimport org.junit.rules.ExpectedException;\n\npublic class TestExy {\n    @Rule\n    public ExpectedException thrown = ExpectedException.none();\n\n    @Test\n    public void shouldThrow() {\n        TestThing testThing = new TestThing();\n        thrown.expect(NotFoundException.class);\n        thrown.expectMessage(startsWith(\"some Message\"));\n        thrown.expect(hasProperty(\"response\", hasProperty(\"status\", is(404))));\n        testThing.chuck();\n    }\n\n    private class TestThing {\n        public void chuck() {\n            Response response = Response.status(Status.NOT_FOUND).entity(\"Resource not found\").build();\n            throw new NotFoundException(\"some Message\", response);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nFor an expanded discussion of the ExpectedException rule, see this blog post.\n"},"Matchers-and-assertThat.html":{"url":"Matchers-and-assertThat.html","title":"Matchers and assertThat","keywords":"","body":"assertThat\nJoe Walnes built a new assertion mechanism on top of what was then JMock 1.

Compare:\nassertTrue(responseString.contains(\"color\") || responseString.contains(\"colour\"));\n// ==> failure message: \n// java.lang.AssertionError:\n\n\nassertThat(responseString, anyOf(containsString(\"color\"), containsString(\"colour\")));\n// ==> failure message:\n// java.lang.AssertionError: \n// Expected: (a string containing \"color\" or a string containing \"colour\")\n//      got: \"Please choose a font\"\n\nCustom Matchers. By implementing the Matcher interface yourself, you can get all of the above benefits for your own custom assertions.\nFor a more thorough description of these points, see Joe Walnes's original post.\nWe have decided to include this API directly in JUnit. It's an extensible and readable syntax, and it enables new features, like assumptions and theories.\nSome notes:\nThe old assert methods are never, ever, going away. Developers may continue using the old assertEquals, assertTrue, and so on.\nThe second parameter of an assertThat statement is a Matcher. We include the Matchers we want as static imports, like this:\nimport static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.is;\n\nor:\nimport static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.*;\n\nManually importing Matcher methods can be frustrating. Eclipse 3.3 includes the ability to define \"Favorite\" classes to import static methods from, which makes it easier (Search for \"Favorites\" in the Preferences dialog). We expect that support for static imports will improve in all Java IDEs in the future.\nTo allow compatibility with a wide variety of possible matchers, we have decided to include the classes from hamcrest-core, from the Hamcrest project. This is the first time that third-party classes have been included in JUnit.\nJUnit currently ships with a few matchers, defined in org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers and org.junit.matchers.JUnitMatchers.\nTo use many, many more, consider downloading the full hamcrest package:\n\nHamcrest page http://code.google.com/p/hamcrest/wiki/Tutorial\nHamcrest Java on GitHub: https://github.com/hamcrest/JavaHamcrest\n\nJUnit contains special support for comparing string and array values, giving specific information on how they differ. This is not yet available using the assertThat syntax, but we hope to bring the two assert methods into closer alignment in future releases.\nJUnit Matchers\nJUnit includes useful matchers for use with the assertThat method, but they are not currently included in the basic CoreMatchers class from hamcrest.\n\nJavadoc JUnitMatchers http://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/latest/org/junit/matchers/JUnitMatchers.html\n\nHamcrest CoreMatchers\nUseful Hamcrest CoreMatchers are included in the JUnit distribution\n\nJavaDoc Hamcrest CoreMatchers http://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/latest/org/hamcrest/CoreMatchers.html\n\nThirdparty Matchers\nOther, potentially Matchers out there include\n\nExcel spreadsheet matchers\nJSON matchers\nXML/XPath matchers\n\n"},"Ignoring-Tests.html":{"url":"Ignoring-Tests.html","title":"Ignoring Tests","keywords":"","body":"Ignoring a Test\nIf for some reason, you don't want a test to fail, you just want it ignored, you temporarily disable a test.\nTo ignore a test in JUnit you can either comment a method, or delete the @Test annotation; but the test runner will not report such a test.

There are two options for implementing this behavior:\nTimeout parameter on @Test Annotation (applies to test method)\nYou can optionally specify timeout in milliseconds to cause a test method to fail if it takes longer than that number of milliseconds.  If the time limit is exceeded, then the failure is triggered by an Exception being thrown:\n@Test(timeout=1000)\npublic void testWithTimeout() {\n  ...\n}\n\nThis is implemented by running the test method in a separate thread. If the test runs longer than the allotted timeout, the test will fail and JUnit will interrupt the thread running the test. If a test times out while executing an interruptible operation, the thread running the test will exit (if the test is in an infinite loop, the thread running the test will run forever, while other tests continue to execute).\nTimeout Rule (applies to all test cases in the test class)\nThe Timeout Rule applies the same timeout to all test methods in a class, and will currently execute in addition to any timeout specified by the timeout parameter on an individual Test annotation.:\nimport org.junit.Rule;\nimport org.junit.Test;\nimport org.junit.rules.Timeout;\n\npublic class HasGlobalTimeout {\n    public static String log;\n    private final CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);\n\n    @Rule\n    public Timeout globalTimeout = Timeout.seconds(10); // 10 seconds max per method tested\n\n    @Test\n    public void testSleepForTooLong() throws Exception {\n        log += \"ran1\";\n        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(100); // sleep for 100 seconds\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void testBlockForever() throws Exception {\n        log += \"ran2\";\n        latch.await(); // will block \n    }\n}\n\nThe timeout specified in the Timeout rule applies to the entire test fixture, including any @Before or @After methods. If the test method is in an infinite loop (or is otherwise not responsive to interrupts) then @After methods will not be called.\nGlobal Timeout Management with JUnit Foundation\nJUnit Foundation provides a timeout management feature that enables you you specify a configurable global timeout interval. The timeout behavior is provided by the JUnit framework via the timeout parameter of the @Test annotation. If no timeout parameter has been specified, or if the configured global timeout specifies a longer interval, JUnit Foundation overrides the @Test annotation with a mutable replacement that specifies the configured timeout parameter.\nTimeout management is applied by HookInstallingRunner, activated by setting the TEST_TIMEOUT configuration option to the desired default test timeout interval in milliseconds.

If this isn't immediately possible, making dependencies explicit can often improve a design. \nFor example, if a test fails when run in a different locale than the developer intended, it can be fixed by explicitly passing a locale to the domain code.\nHowever, sometimes this is not desirable or possible. \nIt's good to be able to run a test against the code as it is currently written, implicit assumptions and all, or to write a test that exposes a known bug. For these situations, JUnit now includes the ability to express \"assumptions\":\n    import static org.junit.Assume.*\n    @Test public void filenameIncludesUsername() {\n        assumeThat(File.separatorChar, is('/'));\n        assertThat(new User(\"optimus\").configFileName(), is(\"configfiles/optimus.cfg\"));\n    }\n\n    @Test public void correctBehaviorWhenFilenameIsNull() {\n       assumeTrue(bugFixed(\"13356\"));  // bugFixed is not included in JUnit\n       assertThat(parse(null), is(new NullDocument()));\n    }\n\nThe default JUnit runner treats tests with failing assumptions as ignored. Custom runners may behave differently.\nWe have included assumeTrue for convenience, but thanks to the inclusion of Hamcrest, we do not need to create assumeEquals, assumeSame, and other analogues to the assert* methods.

Testers can reuse or extend one of the \nprovided Rules below, or write their own.\n\nExample\nFor an example of a rule usage, there follows a test using the TemporaryFolder and ExpectedException rules:\npublic class DigitalAssetManagerTest {\n  @Rule\n  public final TemporaryFolder tempFolder = new TemporaryFolder();\n\n  @Rule\n  public final ExpectedException exception = ExpectedException.none();\n\n  @Test\n  public void countsAssets() throws IOException {\n    File icon = tempFolder.newFile(\"icon.png\");\n    File assets = tempFolder.newFolder(\"assets\");\n    createAssets(assets, 3);\n\n    DigitalAssetManager dam = new DigitalAssetManager(icon, assets);\n    assertEquals(3, dam.getAssetCount());\n  }\n\n  private void createAssets(File assets, int numberOfAssets) throws IOException {\n    for (int index = 0; index \nBase Rules Provided in The Distribution\nTemporaryFolder Rule\n\nThe TemporaryFolder Rule allows creation of files and folders that are deleted when the test method finishes (whether it passes or fails). By default no exception is thrown if resources cannot be deleted:\n\npublic static class HasTempFolder {\n  @Rule\n  public final TemporaryFolder folder = new TemporaryFolder();\n\n  @Test\n  public void testUsingTempFolder() throws IOException {\n    File createdFile = folder.newFile(\"myfile.txt\");\n    File createdFolder = folder.newFolder(\"subfolder\");\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\n\nTemporaryFolder#newFolder(String... folderNames) creates recursively deep temporary folders \nTemporaryFolder#newFile() creates a randomly named new file, and #newFolder() creates a randomly named new folder\nStarting with version 4.13 TemporaryFolder optionally allows strict verification of deleted resources\nwhich fails the test with AssertionError if resources cannot be deleted. This feature can only be opted for by using the #builder() method. By default strict verification is disabled which maintains backward compatibility.\n\n@Rule \npublic TemporaryFolder folder = TemporaryFolder.builder().assureDeletion().build();\n\nExternalResource Rules\n\nExternalResource is a base class for Rules (like TemporaryFolder)\nthat set up an external resource before a test (a file, socket, server,\ndatabase connection, etc.), and guarantee to tear it down afterward:\n\npublic static class UsesExternalResource {\n  Server myServer = new Server();\n\n  @Rule\n  public final ExternalResource resource = new ExternalResource() {\n    @Override\n    protected void before() throws Throwable {\n      myServer.connect();\n    };\n\n    @Override\n    protected void after() {\n      myServer.disconnect();\n    };\n  };\n\n  @Test\n  public void testFoo() {\n    new Client().run(myServer);\n  }\n}\n\nErrorCollector Rule\n\nThe ErrorCollector Rule allows execution of a test to continue\nafter the first problem is found (for example, to collect all the \nincorrect rows in a table, and report them all at once):\n\npublic static class UsesErrorCollectorTwice {\n  @Rule\n  public final ErrorCollector collector = new ErrorCollector();\n\n  @Test\n  public void example() {\n    collector.addError(new Throwable(\"first thing went wrong\"));\n    collector.addError(new Throwable(\"second thing went wrong\"));\n  }\n}\n\nVerifier Rule\n\nVerifier is a base class for Rules like ErrorCollector, which\ncan turn otherwise passing test methods into failing tests if a verification\ncheck is failed.\n\n\npublic static class UsesVerifier {\n\n  private static String sequence;\n\n  @Rule\n  public final Verifier collector = new Verifier() {\n    @Override\n    protected void verify() {\n      sequence += \"verify \";\n    }\n  };\n\n  @Test\n  public void example() {\n    sequence += \"test \";\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void verifierRunsAfterTest() {\n    sequence = \"\";\n    assertThat(testResult(UsesVerifier.class), isSuccessful());\n    assertEquals(\"test verify \", sequence);\n  }\n\n}\n\nTestWatchman/TestWatcher Rules\n\nTestWatcher replaces TestWatchman from version 4.9.  It implements TestRule, not MethodRule\n-- http://junit.org/javadoc/latest/org/junit/rules/TestWatcher.html\nTestWatchman was introduced in JUnit 4.7, it uses a MethodRule, which is now deprecated. \n-- http://junit.org/javadoc/latest/org/junit/rules/TestWatchman.html\nTestWatcher (and the deprecated TestWatchman) are base classes for Rules that take note of the testing action, without modifying it.  For example, this class will keep a log of each passing and failing test:\n\nimport static org.junit.Assert.fail; \nimport org.junit.AssumptionViolatedException; \nimport org.junit.Rule;\nimport org.junit.Test;\nimport org.junit.rules.TestRule;\nimport org.junit.rules.TestWatcher;\nimport org.junit.runner.Description;\nimport org.junit.runners.model.Statement;\n\npublic class WatchmanTest {\n  private static String watchedLog;\n\n  @Rule\n  public final TestRule watchman = new TestWatcher() {\n    @Override\n    public Statement apply(Statement base, Description description) {\n      return super.apply(base, description);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void succeeded(Description description) {\n      watchedLog += description.getDisplayName() + \" \" + \"success!\\n\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void failed(Throwable e, Description description) {\n      watchedLog += description.getDisplayName() + \" \" + e.getClass().getSimpleName() + \"\\n\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void skipped(AssumptionViolatedException e, Description description) {\n      watchedLog += description.getDisplayName() + \" \" + e.getClass().getSimpleName() + \"\\n\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void starting(Description description) {\n      super.starting(description);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void finished(Description description) {\n      super.finished(description);\n    }\n  };\n\n  @Test\n  public void fails() {\n    fail();\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void succeeds() {\n  }\n}\n\nTestName Rule\n\nThe TestName Rule makes the current test name available inside test methods:\n\npublic class NameRuleTest {\n  @Rule\n  public final TestName name = new TestName();\n\n  @Test\n  public void testA() {\n    assertEquals(\"testA\", name.getMethodName());\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void testB() {\n    assertEquals(\"testB\", name.getMethodName());\n  }\n}\n\nTimeout Rule\n\nThe Timeout Rule applies the same timeout to all test methods in a class:\n\npublic static class HasGlobalTimeout {\n  public static String log;\n\n  @Rule\n  public final TestRule globalTimeout = Timeout.millis(20);\n\n  @Test\n  public void testInfiniteLoop1() {\n    log += \"ran1\";\n    for(;;) {}\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void testInfiniteLoop2() {\n    log += \"ran2\";\n    for(;;) {}\n  }\n}\n\nExpectedException Rules\n\nThe ExpectedException Rule allows in-test specification\nof expected exception types and messages:\n\npublic static class HasExpectedException {\n  @Rule\n  public final ExpectedException thrown = ExpectedException.none();\n\n  @Test\n  public void throwsNothing() {\n\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void throwsNullPointerException() {\n    thrown.expect(NullPointerException.class);\n    throw new NullPointerException();\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void throwsNullPointerExceptionWithMessage() {\n    thrown.expect(NullPointerException.class);\n    thrown.expectMessage(\"happened?\");\n    thrown.expectMessage(startsWith(\"What\"));\n    throw new NullPointerException(\"What happened?\");\n  }\n}\n\nClassRule\nThe ClassRule annotation extends the idea of method-level Rules,\nadding static fields that can affect the operation of a whole class.  Any\nsubclass of ParentRunner, including the standard BlockJUnit4ClassRunner \nand Suite classes, will support ClassRules.\nFor example, here is a test suite that connects to a server once before\nall the test classes run, and disconnects after they are finished:\n@RunWith(Suite.class)\n@SuiteClasses({A.class, B.class, C.class})\npublic class UsesExternalResource {\n  public static final Server myServer = new Server();\n\n  @ClassRule\n  public static final ExternalResource resource = new ExternalResource() {\n    @Override\n    protected void before() throws Throwable {\n      myServer.connect();\n    };\n\n    @Override\n    protected void after() {\n      myServer.disconnect();\n    };\n  };\n}\n\nRuleChain\nThe RuleChain rule allows ordering of TestRules:\npublic static class UseRuleChain {\n    @Rule\n    public final TestRule chain = RuleChain\n                           .outerRule(new LoggingRule(\"outer rule\"))\n                           .around(new LoggingRule(\"middle rule\"))\n                           .around(new LoggingRule(\"inner rule\"));\n\n    @Test\n    public void example() {\n        assertTrue(true);\n    }\n}\n\nwrites the log\nstarting outer rule\nstarting middle rule\nstarting inner rule\nfinished inner rule\nfinished middle rule\nfinished outer rule\nCustom Rules\nMost custom rules can be implemented as an extension of the ExternalResource rule. However, if you need more information about the test class or method in question, you'll need to implement the TestRule interface.\nimport org.junit.rules.TestRule;\nimport org.junit.runner.Description;\nimport org.junit.runners.model.Statement;\n\npublic class IdentityRule implements TestRule {\n  @Override\n  public Statement apply(final Statement base, final Description description) {\n    return base;\n  }\n}\n\nOf course, the power from implementing TestRule comes from using a combination of custom constructors, adding methods to the class for use in tests, and wrapping the provided Statement in a new Statement. For instance, consider the following test rule that provides a named logger for every test:\npackage org.example.junit;\n\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\nimport org.junit.rules.TestRule;\nimport org.junit.runner.Description;\nimport org.junit.runners.model.Statement;\n\npublic class TestLogger implements TestRule {\n  private Logger logger;\n\n  public Logger getLogger() {\n    return this.logger;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Statement apply(final Statement base, final Description description) {\n    return new Statement() {\n      @Override\n      public void evaluate() throws Throwable {\n        logger = Logger.getLogger(description.getTestClass().getName() + '.' + description.getDisplayName());\n        base.evaluate();\n      }\n    };\n  }\n}\n\nThen that rule could be applied like so:\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\nimport org.example.junit.TestLogger;\nimport org.junit.Rule;\nimport org.junit.Test;\n\npublic class MyLoggerTest {\n\n  @Rule\n  public final TestLogger logger = new TestLogger();\n\n  @Test\n  public void checkOutMyLogger() {\n    final Logger log = logger.getLogger();\n    log.warn(\"Your test is showing!\");\n  }\n\n}\n\n"},"Theories.html":{"url":"Theories.html","title":"Theories","keywords":"","body":"More flexible and expressive assertions, combined with the ability to state assumptions clearly, lead to a new kind of statement of intent, which we call a \"Theory\". A test captures the intended behavior in one particular scenario. A theory captures some aspect of the intended behavior in possibly infinite numbers of potential scenarios. For example:\n@RunWith(Theories.class)\npublic class UserTest {\n    @DataPoint\n    public static String GOOD_USERNAME = \"optimus\";\n    @DataPoint\n    public static String USERNAME_WITH_SLASH = \"optimus/prime\";\n\n    @Theory\n    public void filenameIncludesUsername(String username) {\n        assumeThat(username, not(containsString(\"/\")));\n        assertThat(new User(username).configFileName(), containsString(username));\n    }\n}\n\nThis makes it clear that the user's username should be included in the config file name, only if it doesn't contain a slash. Another test or theory might define what happens when a username does contain a slash.\nUserTest will attempt to run filenameIncludesUsername on every compatible DataPoint defined in the class. If any of the assumptions fail, the data point is silently ignored. If all of the assumptions pass, but an assertion fails, the test fails.\nThe support for Theories has been absorbed from the Popper project, and more complete documentation can be found from that projects documentation archived here: http://web.archive.org/web/20071012143326/popper.tigris.org/tutorial.html\n(also reproduced below).\nA paper written on theories is here http://web.archive.org/web/20110608210825/http://shareandenjoy.saff.net/tdd-specifications.pdf\nDefining general statements in this way can jog the developer's memory about other potential data points and tests, also allows automated tools to search for new, unexpected data points that expose bugs.\nDocumentation from defunct Popper project\nPopper extends JUnit to allow you to specify theories, general statements about your code's behavior that may be true over infinite sets of input values. For a detailed description of why you might want to do this, see our paper. If you just want to try it out and get started, here's the place.\nFirst, if you haven't already, download the latest Popper. Popper should work with any version of JUnit between 4.0 and 4.3, and Java 5 and above.\nPut Popper and JUnit on your classpath.\nNow, let's start with a simple test class for a type that performs arithmetic on numbers of dollars:\npublic class DollarTest {\n    @Test\n    public void multiplyByAnInteger() {\n        assertThat(new Dollar(5).times(2).getAmount(), is(10));\n    }\n}\n\nThis demonstrates the syntax of JUnit 4 tests written with Popper's assertThat syntax, which is lovingly stolen from Hamcrest. If the @Test syntax is new to you, you may want to quickly get up to speed on JUnit 4. If the convenient assertThat assertion syntax is new, you may want to get up to speed on Hamcrest. (You'll need to add some imports. Eclipse can take care of most of them for you, but here's the whole list)\nGo ahead and get the test above to pass. I especially suggest that you cheat by always returning 10 from getAmount.\nNow, we'll see how Popper extends JUnit to allow the specification and verification of general properties. First, give Dollar test a new superclass:\nimport net.saff.theories.api.TheoryContainer;\n\npublic class DollarTest extends TheoryContainer {\n    // ...\n    // Next, add a theory to the test class:\n\n    @Theory\n    public void multiplyIsInverseOfDivide(int amount, int m) {\n        assumeThat(m, not(0));\n        assertThat(new Dollar(amount).times(m).divideBy(m).getAmount(), is(amount));\n    }\n\nYou'll have to add a divideBy method to Dollar in order to get the class to compile. This theory expresses a general truth about currency multiplication and division: one is the inverse of the other. By adding two parameters to the method, and adding the assumption that m is not zero, you've specified that this theory should hold true for any value of amount and all non-zero values of m.\nGo ahead and run the tests, and you'll notice two things:\n\nYour multiplyByAnInteger test passes as before.\nmultiplyIsInverseOfDivide fails, with the message \"Never found parameters that satisfied method.\"\n\nThe Popper runner does not automatically provide potential values for a theory. It can take a long time between being able to assert a general principle, and actually making it work with any conceivable input. Because of this, Popper expects to only run theories on a set of accepted data points, which allows you to incrementally build up a set of inputs for which you know the theory passes, until you feel confident that the theory is universally true.\nBy default, Popper assumes that all public fields of a test class are accepted data points. For example, add the following constants to DollarTest:\npublic static int TWO = 2;\npublic static int FIVE = 5;\npublic static int TEN = 10;\n\nNow the theory will probably fail, telling you which inputs caused the failure. Fix your implementations of times and divideBy, and the theory should pass.\nTo customize how Popper finds accepted data points, you can use parameter suppliers. One parameter supplier comes with Popper by default, which allows you to specify inline a set of acceptable integer inputs to a theory:\n@Theory\npublic void multiplyIsInverseOfDivideWithInlineDataPoints(\n        @TestedOn(ints = {0, 5, 10}) int amount,\n        @TestedOn(ints = {0, 1, 2}) int m\n) {\n    assumeThat(m, not(0));\n    assertThat(new Dollar(amount).times(m).divideBy(m).getAmount(), is(amount));\n}\n\nThis theory ignores the public fields of DollarTest, and tests with every combination of 0, 5, and 10 for amount, and 0, 1, and 2 for m. Notice that even though 0 is tried as a value for m, it does not trigger an arithmetic exception or failure: values that violate assumptions are quietly ignored.\nYou can extend Popper by providing your own parameter supplier. For example, here is a supplier for values between two integers, and an annotation that references it:\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\n@ParametersSuppliedBy(BetweenSupplier.class)\npublic @interface Between {\n    int first();\n\n    int last();\n}\n\npublic static class BetweenSupplier extends ParameterSupplier {\n    @Override\n    public List getValues(Object test, ParameterSignature sig) {\n        Between annotation = (Between) sig.getSupplierAnnotation();\n\n        ArrayList list = new ArrayList();\n        for (int i = annotation.first(); i \nWith this supplier defined, you can accept data points as ranges:\n@Theory\npublic void multiplyIsInverseOfDivideWithInlineDataPoints(\n        @Between(first = -100, last = 100) int amount,\n        @Between(first = -100, last = 100) int m\n) {\n    assumeThat(m, not(0));\n    assertThat(new Dollar(amount).times(m).divideBy(m).getAmount(), is(amount));\n}\n\nThe paper refers to a capacity for automatically generating stubs to pass as object parameters to theories.\n"},"Test-Fixtures.html":{"url":"Test-Fixtures.html","title":"Test Fixtures","keywords":"","body":"A test fixture is a fixed state of a set of objects used as a baseline for running tests. The purpose of a test fixture is to ensure that there is a well known and fixed environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable. Examples of fixtures:\n\nPreparation of input data and setup/creation of fake or mock objects\nLoading a database with a specific, known set of data\nCopying a specific known set of files\ncreating a test fixture will create a set of objects initialized to certain states.\n\nJUnit provides annotations so that test classes can have fixture run before or after every test, or one time fixtures that run before and after only once for all test methods in a class.\nThere are four fixture annotations: two for class-level fixtures and two for method-level ones.

Without using either option, all tests will be executed by default.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      maven-surefire-plugin\n      \n        com.example.FastTests,com.example.RegressionTests\n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, to exclude a certain list of categories, you would use the  configuration element.\n\n\n\n\nUsing categories with Gradle\n\n\nGradle’s test task allows the specification of the JUnit categories you want to include and exclude.\n\n\n\ntest {\n    useJUnit {\n        includeCategories 'org.gradle.junit.CategoryA'\n        excludeCategories 'org.gradle.junit.CategoryB'\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing categories with SBT\n\n\nSBT’s [junit-interface](https://github.com/sbt/junit-interface) allows the specification of JUnit categories via --include-categories= and --exclude-categories=.\n\n\n[surefire]: http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/junit.html\n[failsafe]: http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/examples/junit.html\n\n\n\n\nTypical usages for categories\n\n\nCategories are used to add metadata on the tests.\n\n\nThe frequently encountered categories usages are about:\n* The type of automated tests: UnitTests, IntegrationTests, SmokeTests, RegressionTests, PerformanceTests …​\n* How quick the tests execute: SlowTests, QuickTests\n* In which part of the ci build the tests should be executed: NightlyBuildTests\n* The state of the test: UnstableTests, InProgressTests\n\n\nThis is also used to add project specific metadata like which feature of a project is covered by the test.\n\n\n[See usages of Junit Categories on github hosted projects ](https://github.com/search?o=asc&p=11&q=%22import+org.junit.experimental.categories.Category%22+%22%40Category%22&ref=searchresults&s=indexed&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93)\n\n\n"},"Use-with-Maven.html":{"url":"Use-with-Maven.html","title":"Use with Maven","keywords":"","body":"Maven Dependency\n\n  junit\n  junit\n  4.12\n  test\n\n\nExecution\nSee Maven Surefire plugin and Maven Failsafe Plugin.\nUse JUnit and Hamcrest in Maven\nVersion 4.11 and later\nUp until now there were two Maven artifacts for JUnit: junit:junit-dep and junit:junit.

If you still reference junit:junit-dep, Maven will automatically relocate you to the new junit:junit and issue a warning for you to fix.\nVersion 4.10 and earlier\nIn your pom.xml, declare dependency used as junit-dep, and also override transitive dependency to hamcrest-core, so you can use Hamcrest full library of matchers:\n\n  org.hamcrest\n  hamcrest-core\n  1.3\n  test\n\n\n  junit\n  junit-dep\n  4.10\n  test\n         \n\n  org.hamcrest\n  hamcrest-library\n  1.3\n  test\n\n\n  org.mockito\n  mockito-core\n  1.9.0\n  test\n\n\nDiscover slowest test from Surefire xml output:\nThe following one-liner described here.\nReports on the test times, slowest sorted to the top:\n$ grep -h \"\n"},"Use-with-Gradle.html":{"url":"Use-with-Gradle.html","title":"Use with Gradle","keywords":"","body":"Gradle Dependency\nMake sure these lines are in your build.gradle\napply plugin: 'java'\n\ndependencies {\n  testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'\n}\n\nExecution\nSee Gradle Java tests for configuration information.
